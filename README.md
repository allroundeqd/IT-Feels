## ✨ Highlights & Key Features

- **IT Feels Music UI Aesthetics**: High-contrast dark themes (Burgundy `#220F19` & Midnight Blue `#090D16`), organic artwork bubble collages (`HeroCollage`), display typography (`Outfit` & `Inter`), dynamic glassmorphism, adaptive frosted control capsule, 3-zone clean top bar, inlined stream quality badges (`320 KBPS`/`LOSSLESS`), and custom squiggly progress bars (`WavySeekBar`).
- **Live Social Suite & Admin Telemetry**: Includes real-time listening parties, direct track sharing to friends' inboxes, reactive in-app broadcasts, and full Admin Dashboard analytics.
- **Native Intent Sharing**: Instantly invite friends to Listen Together rooms using zero-fee native WhatsApp deep links (`url_launcher`).
- **Zero Cognitive Overload UX**: Graceful empty states, smooth animated transitions on all player controls, and zero-wait background video loading that falls back to 60fps album art while resolving streams.
- **Unified Multi-Backend Search Engine**: Concurrently queries both the Saavn API and the IT-Feels Native Catalog, automatically merging, deduplicating, and relevance-sorting results with distinct UI badging.
- **Instant Native Video Extraction**: Bypasses external proxies with a highly optimized local `youtube_explode_dart` engine that strictly fetches pre-muxed 720p streams to guarantee zero-latency audio/video synchronization.
- **Batched Isolates & GC-Yielding**: Background downloading and smart caching runs inside yielding batch loops to give the Dart Garbage Collector time to sweep dead memory, completely preventing OOM crashes on budget devices.
- **Multi-Provider Smart Playlist Engine:** Leverages three highly cost-efficient 2026 LLM backend proxies (ChatGPT `gpt-5.6-luna`, Claude `haiku-4-5-20251001`, Gemini `3.5-flash-lite`) for playlist generation, fully protected and routed via the Cloudflare Edge.
- **Backend E2E Validation:** Ships with a standalone native Node.js testing harness (`npm run test`) for the Cloudflare Worker to rapidly iterate on AI prompts and KV caching without needing the mobile client.
- **Curated Moods & Charts**: Dedicated dynamic tabs for curated mood playlists (with English/Hindi toggle) and top global streaming charts.
- **Hidden Songs Manager**: Full control over your feed with the ability to hide unwanted songs and manage them via a dedicated privacy setting.
- **Fully Populated Library Tabs**: Real dynamic data for `SONGS`, `FAVORITES`, `DOWNLOADS`, `ALBUMS`, `ARTIST`, and `PLAYLISTS`.
- **Offline Download Manager**: Full `DownloadService` allowing users to download 320kbps audio streams (`.mp3`/`.mp4`) and cover art to local device storage (`path_provider`) for offline playback.
- **Full Artist Discography (`ArtistDetailScreen`)**: Artist search (e.g., "Atif Aslam", "Arijit Singh") displays verified artist cards with avatar image, top songs, and discography albums & singles grid.
- **Cloud-Powered High Quality Audio**: Real-time DES-ECB link decryption and 320kbps AAC/MP4 stream URL resolution (`DesDecryptor`), validated remotely via Cloudflare Workers for Premium users.
- **30pt High-Contrast Synced Lyrics**: Devanagari-to-Romanized transliteration (`HinglishTransliterator`) with enlarged 30pt bold active line autoscroll, interactive tap-to-seek playback, and smooth scale transitions.
- **Categorized Audio Quality & Settings**: Dedicated `SettingsScreen` for Wi-Fi streaming quality (`320 kbps` / `160 kbps`), mobile data quality, download quality, storage management, and theme selection.
- **Hero Artwork Transitions & Persistent MiniPlayer**: Seamless morphing of album cover art and persistent MiniPlayer visibility across all internal app routes.
- **Interactive Queue Drawer**: Bottom sheet (`QueueBottomSheet`) displaying upcoming tracks with tap-to-skip functionality.
- **Background Playback & Lockscreen Controls**: Full Android `AudioService` integration with system notification media controls.
